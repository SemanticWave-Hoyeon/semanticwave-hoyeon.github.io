## Reimagining the Ocean through Data

**SemanticWave** is officially setting sail. 

Born at the intersection of deep-sea experience and advanced data science, we are a tech-driven startup dedicated to the **Digital Transformation** of the maritime industry. We don't just process data; we bridge the gap between raw maritime information and actionable intelligence.

### What Defines Us

Our strength lies in the synergy between **on-site maritime expertise** (Navigation & Operations) and **cutting-edge AI research**.

* **Data Analysis & ML**
    : Developing high-precision models for fuel consumption prediction and carbon emission analysis. We transform sensor data into operational efficiency.
* **Semantic Intelligence & NLP — [NavtexRecovery](https://github.com/SemanticWave-Hoyeon/NavtexRecovery)**
    : Applying Natural Language Processing to maritime safety. NavtexRecovery is our open-source tool for AI-powered error recovery in NAVTEX messages, combined with semantic classification of S-100 standard data.
* **Next-Gen Standards (S-100) — [FerriteS100](https://github.com/SemanticWave-Hoyeon/FerriteS100)**
    : Building a free, open-source S-100 framework implementation. FerriteS100 provides tools for parsing, validating, and working with IHO S-100 standard data to accelerate the future of digital e-Navigation.
* **Maritime Cyber Security**
    : Protecting shipboard OT/IT systems and communication networks from emerging cyber threats. We research vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, and resilience strategies for the maritime domain.
