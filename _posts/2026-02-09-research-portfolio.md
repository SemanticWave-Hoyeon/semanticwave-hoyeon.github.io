## Master's Thesis

### A Study on Masked Language Modeling-Based NAVTEX Message Error Restoration Technique for Improving Maritime Safety Information Accuracy
- **Degree**: M.S., Korea Maritime & Ocean University (GPA 4.5/4.5)
- **Link**: [RISS](https://www.riss.kr/link?id=T17277415)
- Proposed a Transformer-based MLM method achieving **90% overall restoration rate** with ≤ 88MB memory and ≤ 8ms inference time, enabling real-time processing in maritime environments.
